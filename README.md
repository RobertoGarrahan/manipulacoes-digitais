# Manipulações Digitais

**Manipulações Digitais** is an interactive digital art project developed collaboratively by **Julia "JaySaq" Alfradique** (Artistic concept, visual design, and narrative structure) and **Roberto Garrahan** (Development, logic and interaction), created for an Arts course project at **UFRJ (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro)**.

The project explores navigation, perception, and choice through a non-linear digital labyrinth composed of interconnected images and physical interaction.

## 🎨 Concept

The website functions as a **digital maze** made up of a sequence of images.  
Each image contains **specific clickable areas** (image mapping) that redirect the user to other images.

- Clicking the *correct* areas allows the user to progress through the labyrinth.
- Incorrect paths lead to alternative images, creating disorientation and exploration.
- By following the right sequence of interactions, the user eventually reaches the end of the maze.

The project blends **digital navigation** with **physical space**, expanding the experience beyond the screen.

## 💡 Physical Interaction (Arduino)

In addition to the digital experience, the project integrates with an **Arduino**:

- Certain interactions trigger **physical lights** in a real-world labyrinth.
- This creates a connection between the virtual maze and a physical installation.
- The digital choices directly influence the physical environment.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript**
- **Image Mapping (`<map>` and `<area>`)**
- **Arduino (hardware interaction)**

No frameworks or libraries were used — the project was intentionally built with **pure web technologies**.

## 🚀 Play the Project

You can experience the project online at the link below:

🔗 **https://robertogarrahan.github.io/manipulacoes-digitais/congrats**

This page represents the **final destination of the labyrinth**.  
It is intentionally the only place where explanations about the project are provided, reinforcing the idea that the homepage should remain silent and allow the experience to unfold naturally through play.
